What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, all the files in that repository are made ready to be cloned on the git site. This needs to be done in order to create an online accessible version-control system for a local repository
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is like a temporary location in git where we can temporarily add our files before commiting them to repository. One advantage is that it we can even remove the files from staging area if we dont wish to add them to the repository
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use just "git diff" command to know the changes between working directory & staging area & check if there are more than one logical changes made. Once I add the changes using git add, the output of git diff will be empty. Then after running "git diff --staged" it will show the changes between staging area & repo, & after commiting them, the output of that cmd will also be empty
