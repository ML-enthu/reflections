What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, all the files in that repository are made ready to be cloned on the git site. This needs to be done in order to create an online accessible version-control system for a local repository
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
