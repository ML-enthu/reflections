When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to access my files remotely from a different computer or when someone else wants to add to my existing files
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I may be working on something particular & won't want to copy those remote files untill I am done working on them
